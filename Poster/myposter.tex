Motion correction for dynamic contrast MR myocardial perfusion is of significant 
research interest and has resulted in several techniques generally characterized 
as rigid or non-rigid image registration-based. To bring together interested 
researchers for discussion and comparison of methods for correction of motion 
artefacts and the development of performance benchmarks of such techniques, the 
Statistical Atlases and Computational Modeling of the Heart (STACOM) workshop 
committee organized a motion correction challenge to be held in conjunction with 
international 2014 conference of the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted 
Intervention (MICCAI) Society.

For comparative evaluation, each team was given MR perfusion 
data described by the organizers:
\begin{quote}
The evaluation dataset consists of 10 cases from two centres: the University of Utah and University of Auckland. For each case, a single short axis slice time series at rest and at stress is provided. The Utah datasets were acquired using a saturation-recovery radial turboFLASH sequence at rest and during adenosine infusion (140 $\mu$g/kg/min), as described in \cite{dibella2012}. Contrast was 5 cc/s injection of Multihance (Gd-BOPTA) at 0.02 mmol/kg for the rest and 0.03 mmol/kg for the stress. Four of these subjects have known coronary artery disease. The Auckland cases were acquired using a saturation-recovery Cartesian turboFLASH sequence at rest and during adenosine infusion (140 $\mu$g/kg/min). Contrast was 0.04 mmol/kg Omniscan (gadodiamide). None of the Auckland cases have overt coronary disease. Expert-drawn contours only at a reference frame, chosen when contrast is present in both ventricles, were provided to the participants.

Given the temporal image variability and other confounds (e.g., noise), a multivariate 
image registration strategy was employed made possible by recent developmental work 
to the Insight Toolkit \cite{avants2014}.  This strategy involved the following three
derived images:
\begin{itemize}
  \item N4 bias corrected \cite{tustison2010},
  \item noise-filtered, structure-preserving SUSAN image \cite{smith1997}, and
  \item low level Laplacian-based edge detection.
\end{itemize}

Sample preprocessed images used:

{\bf Theory}
\vspace{0.5em} 

The Symmetric Normalization (SyN) diffeomorphic approach \cite{avants2008} to pairwise image 
registration minimizes the following symmetric formulation:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:syn}
  \inf_{\phi_1} \inf_{\phi_2}   \Bigg[
                     \int_0^{0.5} & \left( \|v_1(t)\|_L^2 + \|v_2(t)\|_L^2 \right) dt \nonumber \\
                     &+
                     \int_{\Omega} \Pi_{\sim}
                          \left( I \circ \phi_1^{-1}(\mathbf{x},0.5),
                           J \circ \phi_2^{-1}(\mathbf{x},0.5) \right) d\Omega \Bigg]
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \frac{d \phi_i(\mathbf{x},t)}{dt} = v_i( \phi_i(\mathbf{x},t), t ),\,\, \phi_i(\mathbf{x},0) = \mathbf{Id}, \,\, i \in \{1,2\}
\end{align}
and $\Pi_{\sim}$ is an arbitrary similarity metric (or metrics).  

\vspace{0.5em} 
{\bf Greedy B-Spline SyN variant}
\vspace{0.5em} 

A greedy variant of Eq. (\ref{eq:syn})  was also proposed
in \cite{avants2008} for purposes of tractability and illustrated below.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../Figures/SyN.pdf}
\end{center}
Images $I$ and $J$ are registered by finding the optimal 
two transform pairs $\left(\phi_1,\phi_1^{-1}\right)$
  $\left(\phi_2,\phi_2^{-1}\right)$ which map to/from
  the respective images to the midway point. 
  Regularization using a fast B-spline fitting algorithm
  provides a contrast to the traditional Gaussian smoothing and has demonstrated
  measurable improvement in brain MR image normalization \cite{tustison2013}.

\vspace{0.5em} 
{\bf Transform composition to reference frame}
\vspace{0.5em} 
  
SyN yields both the forward and inverse transforms between images $I$ and $J$ denoted
as $I \underset{b}{\leftrightsquigarrow} J$ (where `$b$' denotes ``B-spline SyN'').
Thus, to transform any image, $I_t$, at time point, $t$, to the 
reference image, $I_R$, temporally located at time, $t=r$, we simply concatenate 
the transforms either forwards
\begin{align}
I_R  \underset{b_r}{\leftrightsquigarrow} \underset{b_{r+1}}{\leftrightsquigarrow} \cdots
      \underset{b_{t-2}}{\leftrightsquigarrow}\underset{b_{t-1}}{\leftrightsquigarrow} I_t
\end{align}
or backwards
\begin{align}
I_R  \underset{b_{r-1}}{\leftrightsquigarrow} \underset{b_{r-2}}{\leftrightsquigarrow} \cdots
      \underset{b_{t+1}}{\leftrightsquigarrow}\underset{b_t}{\leftrightsquigarrow} I_t.
\end{align}
By concatenating transforms, only a single interpolation is performed for each normalization 
to the reference frame.

% SCCA demonstrates significant differences between the control and patient groups in both the FA ($p < 0.002$) and gray matter ($p < 0.04$)	that	are	widespread 	but	largely	focus	on	 thalamocortical networks related to the limbic system. Specific regional differences included the medial thalamic nuclei, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and fornix. Using these SCCA-identified regions, we demonstrate a strong correlation ($p < 0.01$) of the degree of injury in WM and GM within the patient group.
